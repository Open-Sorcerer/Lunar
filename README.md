Lunar is an innovative bridge that streamlines the process of transferring SOL tokens from Solana to Eclipse. By leveraging Solana's Blockchain Links (blinks), Lunar provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for newcomers and experienced users alike.

## Why Lunar?

Lunar was created with one primary goal: to make onboarding to Eclipse as simple and intuitive as possible. Here's how Lunar achieves this:

1. **One-Click Bridging**: Transfer your SOL to Eclipse with just a few clicks, eliminating complex multi-step processes.

2. **Familiar Interface**: Utilizes Solana's blink technology, providing a consistent experience for Solana users.

3. **No New Wallets Required**: Use your existing Solana wallet to bridge assets, reducing friction and potential security risks.

4. **Instant Feedback**: Receive immediate confirmation of your bridge transaction, enhancing user confidence.

5. **Transparent Process**: Clear, step-by-step guidance throughout the bridging process, making it accessible even to blockchain newcomers.
